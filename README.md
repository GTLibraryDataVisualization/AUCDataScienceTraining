# AUCDataScienceTraining

At this workshop we will be using Python library Pandas and Plotly to create two frames of visualization about our COVID dataset to draw some insights. The visualizations will be upload them to Chart-Studio for easy online interaction and sharing.

The development environment we are going to use is Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb. You won't need to set up the environment on your local device, but please make sure that you have a google account.
