# AUCDataScienceTraining

At this workshop we will be using Python library Pandas and Plotly to create two frames of visualization and upload them to Chart-Studio for easy online interaction and sharing.

The development environment we are going to use is Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb. You won't need to set up the environment on your local device, but please make sure that you have a google account.
